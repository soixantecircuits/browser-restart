## Develop

#### Prerequisites

* `node >= v4.0.0` ([download here](http://nodejs.org))
* `webpack` ([download here](https://github.com/webpack/webpack))
* Follow [JavaScript Standard Style](https://github.com/feross/standard) and use a [text editor plugin](https://github.com/feross/standard#text-editor-plugins)

#### Install dependencies

```
$ npm install
```
*(Yeoman should have done this for you)*

##### A note about webpack

We use webpack to manage dependencies loading through the app. Basically, it compiles them all into one `bundle.js` file and handle the `require([module])` stuffs. This means we **exclusively** use `npm` to manage our external dependencies.

Webpack does not only manage `js` modules, but also `css` stylesheets and all the app assets (images, videos, `json` datas, ...). It can be a bit confusing at first to load your stylesheets with a `require('../styles/main.css')` (cf. [entry script](src/entry.js)) instead of a good old `<link>` tag, but it keeps the workflow clean. This also mean we load assets in `js`.

Instead of doing:
```html
<img src="assets/my-img.png" />
```
You do:
```html
<img class="img-selector" />
```
```js
  document.querySelector('img-selector').src = require('../assets/my-img.png')

```

*the css loader will do this for you, so you can just load your assets with `url(../my/image.png)`, just use its absolute path.*

Finally, webpack itself is modular and you can add many [loaders](https://webpack.github.io/docs/loaders.html) to handle what you need to handle. Just `npm i --save` the ones you need.

*If you find a good read about how to properly load assets with webpack, we'd really like to take a look !*

#### Run

##### In the browser

```
$ gulp dev
```

##### In electron

```
$ gulp dev
```

And in an other shell window:

```
$ npm start
```

## Build

```
$ webpack
$ npm run build
```

Builds the app for OS X, Linux, and Windows, using [electron-packager](https://github.com/maxogden/electron-packager). It will result in an [asar packaged](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/application-packaging.md) app.

We also provides more developer friendly build scripts:
```
$ npm run build-osx # unpackaged osx 64bits app
$ npm run build-linux # unpackaged linux 64bits app
$ npm run build-win # unpackaged windows 64bits app
```
